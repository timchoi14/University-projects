<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!--
[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)
-->

In this project, we will design a server and client program for a chat application using Python. 
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">The server will mediate chat sessions between clients.
<br/>
The clients will be limited to 2 per simultaneous chat session.
</br/>
Code will explicitly create sockets, send data and receive data from the sockets. 
</div><br/>


## To Dos

###  <span style="color:#0074CC">1.Connection to the Server</span>
A client needs to connect first to the server. Connection to the server is initiated when a user logs on.
1. When the user at client A logs on, client A sends a HELLO (Client-ID-A) message to the server, using UDP transport.
2. The server verifies that Client-ID-A is an ID on the list of subscribers. If so, the server retrieves the client’s secret key and sends a CHALLENGE (rand) message to the client, using UDP.
3. The client responds with a RESPONSE (Res) to authenticate itself. If authentication is not successful, the server sends an AUTH_FAIL message to the client. Else the server generates an encryption key CK-A, then sends an AUTH_SUCCESS(rand_cookie, port_number) message to the client. The message is encrypted by CK-A.
4. The client generates the same CK-A key, and decrypts the message. From this point on, all data exchanged between client A and the server is encrypted using CK-A.
5. Client A establishes a TCP connection to the port at port_number and sends a CONNECT (rand_cookie) to the server. From this point on, until the TCP connection is closed, all data (signaling messages and chat) is exchanged over the TCP connection.
6. The server sends CONNECTED to the client. The client is connected.
7. The client tears down the TCP connection when the user types “Log off” or when the activity timer expires.

###  <span style="color:#0074CC">2. Client A Initiates Chat Session to Client B</span>
This scenario will go through the following steps. Client A must have already gone through the
connection phase and be connected to the server.
1. To start a chat with client B, the end user types “Chat Client-ID-B”, and client A sends a
CHAT_REQUEST (Client-ID-B). If the server determines client-B is connected and not
already engaged in another chat session, the server sends CHAT_STARTED(session-ID,
Client-ID-B) to client A, and CHAT_STARTED(session-ID, Client-ID-A) to client B. Client A
and Client B are now engaged in a chat session and can send chat messages with each
other, through the server. The clients display “Chat started” to the end user at A and B. If
client B is not available, the server sends UNREACHABLE (Client-ID-B) to client A.
2. When the end user at A or B wants to terminate the session, the end user types “End
Chat”, and the associated Client sends END_REQUEST (session-ID) to the server.
3. The server sends an END_NOTIF(session-ID) to the other client. The Clients display “Chat
ended” to their respective end users.
###  <span style="color:#0074CC">3. Security</span>
####  <span style="color:#0074CC">Authentication</span>
The server is assumed secure, and only the client needs to be authenticated. Authentication is
based on the challenge/response mechanism, used in cellular networks.
Upon receiving HELLO (Client-ID-A), the server looks up Client A’s secret key K_A. Then it
generates a random number rand. Rand and K_A are input into an authentication algorithm A3.
The output, XRES, is stored by the server. Then the server sends rand in the CHALLENGE (rand).
Client A is expected to run the same algorithm A3 with the same inputs rand and K_A, and
produce RES, which is sent to the server in the RESPONSE (Res) message. If RES matches XRES,
the server has authenticated the client. For this assignment, use a hash function for algorithm
A3: RES = hash1(rand + K_A), where + denotes concatenation. Examples are MD5, SHA1,
SHA256 etc.
####  <span style="color:#0074CC">Encryption</span>
Concurrently with the above authentication process, the server and client run an A8 algorithm,
which takes as input rand and K_A, to generate a ciphering key CK_A. For this assignment, use a
hash function for A8: CK_A = hash2(rand + K_A).
####  <span style="color:#0074CC">Integrity protection</span>
For simplicity, integrity protection is not implemented.
###  <span style="color:#0074CC">4. Chat History</span>
In addition, the server will maintain chat history of each client. At any time in the connected
state, client A can see the history of past chat messages with client B by sending the
HISTORY (Client-ID-B) message to the server. In response the server sends all the past chat
messages exchanged between client A and client B. Client A should display all the chat
messages in the history in the following format
<session_id> <from: sending client> &lt;chat message>

###  <span style="color:#0074CC">5. Protocol Messages</span>
The significant fields of the messages along with their semantics are defined below. As part of
the project assignment, you have to define the precise syntax and format of the messages.
* HELLO (Client-ID-A): Initiates the process for Client A to be authenticated and
registered with the server.
* CHALLENGE (rand): Sent by the server to challenge the client to authenticate itself. rand
is a random number generated by the server. A new rand is generated at every
CHALLENGE.
* RESPONSE (client-ID, Res): Response to the challenge, sent by the client to authenticate
itself.
* AUTH_SUCCESS(rand_cookie, port_number): Sent by the server to notify the client
authentication is successful. rand_cookie is a random number generated by the server,
and port_number is a TCP port number assigned by the server for subsequent
connection by the client.
* AUTH_FAIL: Sent by the server to notify the client authentication has failed
* CONNECT (rand_cookie): Sent by the client to the server. rand_cookie is the cookie
previously sent by the server.
* CONNECTED: Sent by the server to notify the client it has been connected
* CHAT_REQUEST (Client-ID-B): Sent by client A to the server to request a chat session
with Client B
* CHAT_STARTED (session-ID, Client-ID-B): Sent by the server to notify client A that a chat
session with client B has started. Session-ID is an ID assigned to the session
* UNREACHABLE (Client-ID-B): Sent by the server to client A to notify client B is not
available for chat.
* END_REQUEST (session-ID): Sent by any of the clients involved in the chat session to
request a termination of the session
* END_NOTIF (session-ID): Sent by the server to notify a client involved in the session that
the session has been terminated by another client.
* CHAT (session-ID, chat message): Exchanged between the clients, relayed by the server.
Carries the actual chat message
* HISTORY_REQ (Client-ID-B): Sent by client A to request the history of past chat
messages with client B.
* HISTORY_RESP (Sending Client-ID, chat message): Sent by the server to the client who
requested the history. Sending Client-ID is the ID of the client who sent the chat
message, and chat message is the chat message in the history. There is one
HISTORY_RESP message for each chat message in the history.

## Assignnment Grading Criteria

General Note: The following are criteria used to come up with a team grade. Your final
individual project score is not necessarily the team grade, it may be flexed up or down,
depending on your individual contribution to the team and the quality of your individual report.
### <span style="color:#0074CC">Coding (60%)</span>
Source code of your well-structured and well-documented program. Include comments
on your codes for clarification. In addition, your project has to meet the validation
scenarios. Generally, “connection phase” weigh 25% and “chat phase” weigh 35%. You
should be able to demonstrate good understanding of the code and be able to
answer specific questions on the code and design.
### <span style="color:#0074CC">Documents (40%)</span>
Group Report (40%): The group report will be evaluated not only on its content, but also
the professionalism of its appearance.
